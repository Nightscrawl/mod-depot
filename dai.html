                            <h2>Invisible Unequipped Weapons</h2>
                            <p>
                                As the name says, this makes the default weapons, seen even when you have unequipped your standard weapons, invisible. You are still able to attack things, you just can't see the weapons.
                            </p>
        
                            <p>
                                It should be noted that this mod is different from the other invisible weapon mod, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonageinquisition/mods/990" target="_blank">Invisible Weapons and Shield</a>. That mod edits every single weapon part to make that specific model invisible, while mine only removes the visual appearance from the unequipped weapon template. As a result, you will not have visible unequipped weapons, but actual weapons that you equip using that same model, such as the very first ones you get in the tutorial fight, still appear as normal once you equip them.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Do you want your Inquisitor to have black hair? Do you dislike the grayish "black" BioWare has given as the option? Are you tired of using the save editor to get black hair?
                            </p>
        
                            <p>
                                If the answer to those are three resounding "Yes!" then this is the mod for you! It edits BioWare's "black" to be a true black. 
                            </p>

                                I started out wanting to fix the unfortunate texture issues on Dorian's back and ended up expanding this to other various gear edits and changes.

                            <h2>Dorian's Darker Brows</h2>
                            <p>
                                Dorian's eyebrows are fine, for the most part. Where they are NOT fine is if you play with any anti-alias setting lower than 4x MSAA or if you turn it off completely; they look pixelated and you can clearly see an outline. The main reason for this is that the alpha map is only 512px, whereas the same eyebrow texture for all of the other followers and advisors is 2048px. How could they do that to Dorian?!
                            </p>
        
                            <p>
                               My primary goal with this mod was to get an eyebrow that looked good for those times where I don't want to use MSAA. This does have the benefit of also improving the appearance with MSAA as well. The eyebrows are now darker, as befitting a man of his coloring, more defined, and the alpha map is enlarged and also more defined. 
                            </p>

                               My favorite skin complexion (for men) is the very first, but the ruddy veins have always bothered me. I discovered that these were not painted directly on the skin diffuse, but added via tint map. For this edit, I removed them from the tint map, so the associated skin complexion is clear.

                                Ever notice how the chair in Josephine's office, as well as its twin in the Skyhold library, is rather, well... gross? It is very low res, horribly pixelated, and looks terribly awful in cinematics where it features as a set piece. This mod aims to fix that.

                                The <i>Art of Dragon Age: Inquisition</i> says, "The colors of the Inquisition are charcoal gray and crimson, evoking the Inquisition's ties to the Seekers, in black, and the Templars, in red."

                                This is a re-texture of the Skyhold attire for human males.

                            <p>
                                In my edit I also "fixed" some very minor graphical problems present in the default version, like a non-shiny lace eyelet on the pants. The pattern is Dales Loden Wool, featuring the Inquisition sigil. I decided to leave the jacket the default color for tinting purposes, as I discovered when using other 'pj' mods that a colored jacket changes the look of any armor where the Skyhold attire is visible underneath, like the various mage armors. However, I do think that the darker pants and boots make a significant difference.
